## Exercise: Voting Eligibility Checker

### Objective:

Write a Java program to determine whether a person is eligible to vote based on age and citizenship status. 

The program should ask the user to enter their age and citizenship status, and then display whether they are eligible to vote or not, considering the following criteria:

-	A person must be at least 18 years old to be eligible to vote.
-	A person must be a citizen to be eligible to vote.
-	Use the Boolean logical operators to evaluate the conditions.

### Instructions:

1. Ask the user to enter their age.
2. Ask the user to enter their citizenship status (true for citizen, false for non-citizen).
3. Use Boolean logical operators to check if the person is eligible to vote:
4. Use a short circuit operator to check if the person is at least 18 years old and a citizen.
5. Display the result whether the person is eligible to vote or not.
